## Clearances or Goals

We know one thing about the Brownlow medal- its a midfielders award. In the last 10 years, every winner (aside from being a disposal dominant midfielder) has been elite with either goals or clearances.

Since 2010, the winner has been in the league top 5 for average clearances per game. The only exceptions to this are 2011, 2013 and 2017 where Dane Swan, Gary Ablett and Dustin Martin were the winners. However, for what they lacked in clearances, they more then made up for with goals. For these 3 players in those years, the lowest goals kicked was 28.   

Could Lachie Neale defy this trend? He's kicked 11 goals for the year so safe to say he wont get to the 30 mark with 4 rounds to go.

He's also coming 8th in average clearances currently at 5.6 and would need to topple Adam Treloar who is currently sitting 5th on 5.8. Even if he were to achieve this it would be well below the threshold by previous winners.

Could this mean we (including ourselves here at footygeekz) are all getting the brownlow medal favourite for 2020 wrong? Its not long until we find out in what should be another thrilling vote count.
