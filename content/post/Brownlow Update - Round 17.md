## Brownlow is Neales to lose

footygeeks modelling has given every indication that the Brownlow medal this year is Lachie Neale's to lose. With one round to go, Neale is is currently 10 votes clear at the top with the next best vote getter being Zach Merret. Given Essendons poor year, its likely Merret wont poll as strongly as the model has suggested but only time will tell.
