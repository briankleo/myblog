## Neale still in pole position 

Round 13 saw the lead that Lachie Neale has at the top of the leadership reduce. He remains on top of the projected brownlow leaderboard for the year under both my model (10 votes ahead) and the supercoach model (4 votes) ahead. 

My model is based on a number of player variables from a match that includes Supercoach and AFL Fantasy scores, Disposals, Goals and final margin. The supercoach model looks primarily at supercoach scores and assigns votes to the top 3 players per match. 

Other insights include:

Based on my model Jackson Macrae, Taylor Adams and Zach Merret have not been historically strong vote getters despite having productive years. Yet they find themselves with a very strong chance of placing in the top 3 with 5 rounds to go.

In the supercoach model, there are 3 ruckmen in Todd Goldstein, Max Gawn and Brodie Grundy in the top 6 for the year so far.

The betting agencies currently have Neale, Christian Petracca, Travis Boak and Dustin Martin as the favourites to win in that order. From these favourites the first 3 are in the top 7 of my model while the SC model only has Neale in the top 10.
