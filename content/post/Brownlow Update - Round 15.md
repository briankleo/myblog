## Captaincy Curse?

A top 10 draft prodigy form the Geelong Falcons footy factory and a smoky for this year’s Brownlow. Many may first think of Patrick Dangerfield with that description however Travis Boak is on a mission to prove many critic’s wrong since 2018. After declining performances on field since taking on the burden of club captain in 2013, Travis Boak is now consistently generating elite numbers in Season 14 and doesn’t looking like slowing down anytime soon. There was no doubt about Boaks quality as midfielder with Geelong pressing for hard for his signature in 2012. It is now a lock that he’ll be a one club player and have 300 games next to his name to top off a well respected career.

It raises the question on how much weight one player carries whilst holding captaincy.
